**_Definitions matters or not ?_** 

According to the DPIIT, an entity will be considered a ‘startup’ up to a period of 10 years from the date of incorporation/registration 
*and* if its *turnover for any* of the financial years since incorporation/registration does not exceed *INR 100 crore*.

How often does media - mainstream or otherwise - continue to apply the startup tag to companies while their revenues
 are clearly are above INR 100 Cr mark ? 

Quite often.

Can we stick to the definitions and apply right labels to companies for an accurate repesentation of reality ?
