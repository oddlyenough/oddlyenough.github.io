**_Two is odd because it is the only even prime._** 

I heard the above statement in a number theory class at college. It has kind of stuck in my mind since then. It is an odd statement in that it makes sense but the first part is not correct in the world of mathematics. 
Sometimes I feel that I am odd. I am sure others have felt the same about me.  

So in these pages of Oddly Enough, my attempt would be to make sense of things going on in my life and explain some of my oddities as well. For example, joining a company, staying at the same company for an extended period of time and stepping out of the company.

Even Steven ?
Odd Bod.
