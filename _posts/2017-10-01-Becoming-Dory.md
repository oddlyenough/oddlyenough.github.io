I watched the movie "Finding Dory" today on the TV. Had to suffer through few ad breaks. But what
a wonderful movie. I was looking forward to watching this in the theatres when it was released,
but missed doing so. The movie and the folks at Pixar did not disappoint. 

In the climax, Dory urges Hank (the septopus) to join her in the open ocean. There are these
lines about how she never planned anything and everything she got was by chance.

Fun fact flashed during on the breaks was that Dory is the most liked Pixar character on Facebook. 
The movie made me want to join Facebook just to add one more like !

I used to think about these lines from the movie Speed whenever it I felt like I was
in a tough spot.

**_What do you do Jack ?_**

Now I have a better line for those kinds of situations.

**_What would Dory do ? _**

The final scene where Marlin and Dory meet at the edge was also beautiful.Dory mentions that Marlin
looks worried. Marlin admits that he is always worried. Without the short-term memory loss ! 

I am bit like Marlin. Becoming a bit more like Dory would help.
